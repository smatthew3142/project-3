Development Notes:

Made the following Changes:

1.  Add the file under the controllers folder: ecos.js (this file handles the scraping)

Models
1.  Update to the animals schema, change the lowercase "a" to uppercase "A" (not sure if this makes a difference)

Routes
Add two controller folder links to the routes/animals.js file

Change the route to include for view all /all
and the scrape  /scrape

for this project I don't believe we will be removing from or updating to the animals db
